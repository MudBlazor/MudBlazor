@* MudRender is a container component that only renders its content, so it really doesn't do anything other than giving you the ability to force a re-render of its content
    This is especially useful if you don't want to render the whole tree for some reason. All you need to force a renderupdate of its content is to call ForceRender() on an 
    ElementReference to MudRender

@ChildContent

@code {
#nullable enable
    /// <summary>
    /// The content to render
    /// </summary>
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }

    /// <inheritdoc />
    void IMudStateHasChanged.StateHasChanged() => StateHasChanged();
