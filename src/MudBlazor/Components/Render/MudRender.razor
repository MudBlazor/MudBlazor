@* MudRender is a container component that only renders its content, so it really doesn't do anything other than giving you the ability to force a re-render of its content
    This is especially useful if you don't want to render the whole tree for some reason. All you need to force a renderupdate of its content is to call ForceRender() on an 
    ElementReference to MudRender
