                <Description>
                    <MudText>For technology to thrive, many different circumstances need to come together. Early on, we saw vast potential in Blazor and wanted to contribute to the success of this technology in our way. </MudText>

            <SectionHeader Title="First step: MudBlazor as a component library ">
                <Description>
                    <MudText>What was missing was an easy-to-use yet visually compelling component library. Providing developers with a comfortable way to produce awesome-looking UIs for their customers out of the box would make working with Blazor an even more enjoyable task. With other core principles, this idea resulted in MudBlazor: An material design inspired Blazor Component library. </MudText>
                    <MudText>What a component library does is offload everyday UI tasks from the developer. For instance, a Blazor developer wants to display certain information within a "tabbed" view. No problem: we can offer <code>MudTab</code>. Does a developer need a button that remembers the click state? Take the <code>MudToogleButton</code>, and there are fewer things you need to worry about.</MudText>
                    <MudText>We are happy and proud to see people around the globe and various industries using MudBlazor to make their development faster, more reliable, and create a better experience for their users. </MudText>

                <Description>
                    <MudText>While we consider MudBlazor a big success regarding our vision, we know this can only be the first step. There are still more obstacles for developers or ways to make their life easier. During the upcoming months, we will start products around MudBlazor to fulfill this goal. </MudText>
                    <MudText>You will be able to sell and buy custom themes in the MudStore, supporting you in starting more rapidly and efficiently or offering your design skills to a broader audience. </MudText>
                    <MudText>With the MudAcademy, we will start a program bootstrapping and accelerating your knowledge growth around Blazor. </MudText>
                    <MudText>And this is just the beginning of many Mud around the Place. Stay tuned for our latest updates. </MudText>

                <Description>
                    <MudText>Empowerment is not an act of a single person or team. We are so happy that developers are actively engaging in the MudCommunity. So many have spent (and are still spending) hours of their life to help us improve the library, asking and answering questions on Github or Discord, speaking at conferences, podcasts and with their colleagues, and in endless more ways. We are proud and grateful for your support and thanks for your engagement: Each day of your work brings us closer to our vision. </MudText>
                    <MudText>This incredible community has always been a driver and source of motivation. We are confident that the new products will enrich the community and provide many more opportunities to engage.</MudText>
                    <MudText>We want to invite you to join this community as well.</MudText>
