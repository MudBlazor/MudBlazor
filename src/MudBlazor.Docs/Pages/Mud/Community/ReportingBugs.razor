                <Description>
                    Consider if it's really a bug, sometimes it happens that the concept or use case has been misunderstood.<br/>
                    If you're looking to get help with something, we'd love to help you - but the best way to do that is through <MudLink Href="/mud/community/getting-help">asking for help</MudLink> rather than reporting a bug.

                <Description>
                    Search through the <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues" Target="_blank">issues</MudLink> and <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/discussions" Target="_blank">discussions</MudLink> first. If you find anything that seems like the same thing, comment on that one instead of creating a duplicate.

            <SectionHeader Title="Minimal reproduction">
                <Description>
                    It's important to be able to reproduce the bug reliably - in a minimal way and separately from the rest of the project. This narrows down what could be causing the problem and allows people to not only find the cause but also test potential solutions, and finally a pull request with the issue fixed.
                    Start with TryMudBlazor, if it can be repoduced there you can save the code snippet and attatch it with the issue. If not provide a link to a github repository with a minimal reproduction (No complete applications).
