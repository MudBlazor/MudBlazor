            MudBlazor version 7.0.0 is officially released, bringing many new features along with several breaking changes that were holding us back, and which we don't want to postpone any longer as we strive for more consistency and innovation.

        <Description>
            .NET 6 is no longer supported and .NET 7 is the new minimum version.
            We recommend switching to <MudLink Href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0" Target="_blank">.NET 8 LTS</MudLink> for the best experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you still need .NET 6, you can stay on the v6.x.x branch which is still supported.
            We'll fix critical bugs and security issues, but new features will only come to version 7.
            <br />
