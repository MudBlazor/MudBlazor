    <SectionHeader Title="A Company behind the Mud">
        <Description>
            Over the past year, a lot of companies have contacted me and asked about MudBlazor. All of them have one thing in common, they want to be reassured that if they pick MudBlazor for their product, it won't be gone or abandoned one rainy  morning when they wake up.<br/>
            <br/>
            And I am extremely happy and proud of what we have managed to do with MudBlazor so far. I want to keep making it better and making sure it's one of the best libraries out there.<br/>
            <br/>
            To do this I have started a company that is going to be behind the mud. Nothing will change from how things are done today, it will still be open source and our MIT license will stay the same.<br/>
            <br/>
            We might launch some extra services in the future depending on how big interest there is for such a thing. But for now nothing is set in stone.<br/>
