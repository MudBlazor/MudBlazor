            MudBlazor version 7.0.0 will bring many new features and several breaking changes that were holding us back and which we don't want to postpone any longer as we strive for more consistency and innovation.

            We are working hard to get the release ready so keep an eye on <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor" Target="_blank">our GitHub</MudLink> to stay up-to-date.
            Pre-releases will be available there and <MudLink Href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MudBlazor" Target="_blank">on NuGet</MudLink> for testing.

        <Description>
            .NET 6 is no longer supported and we recommend switching to <MudLink Href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0" Target="_blank">.NET 8 LTS</MudLink>, but .NET 7 is still available as the new minimum version.

            If you still need .NET 6 you can stay on the latest v6.x.x version which is still supported.
            We will fix critical bugs or security issues, but new features will only come to version 7.
            If you found a bug that you want backported to v6.x.x, submit a <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/pulls" Target="_blank">pull request</MudLink> and we'll include it in an update.
