            MudBlazor version 7.0.0 is on its way and will bring many new features along with several breaking changes that were holding us back, and which we don't want to postpone any longer as we strive for more consistency and innovation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We're working hard to get the release ready; Keep an eye on <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor" Target="_blank">our GitHub</MudLink> to stay up-to-date!
            Pre-releases will be available there and <MudLink Href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MudBlazor" Target="_blank">on NuGet</MudLink> for testing.

        <Description>
            .NET 6 is no longer supported and .NET 7 is the new minimum version.
            We recommend switching to <MudLink Href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0" Target="_blank">.NET 8 LTS</MudLink> for the best experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you still need .NET 6 you can stay on the latest v6.x.x version which is still supported.
            We will fix critical bugs or security issues, but new features will only come to version 7.
            <br />
            Found a bug that you want backported to v6.x.x? Submit a <MudLink Href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/pulls" Target="_blank">pull request</MudLink> and we'll include it in an update.
