# MudBlazor Roadmap

MudBlazor is stable, the number of bugs has gone down dramatically and no big development is going on at the moment (except MudDataGrid). Since this is a non-commercial project we rely heavily on our users for bug fixes. 
We try to review and merge important bug fixes as soon as possible. If your bug-fix PR is overlooked, make sure to tag a team member.

## MudDataGrid

This component is still under development and is hopefully going to be completed in the upcoming months.  

## Future .NET Versions
.NET 7 is fully supported. Supporting future .NET versions is our top priority.

## Upcoming Breaking Changes

Since we have put off breaking changes for a very long time, we'll merge all breaking changes and remove all obsolete parameters 
when we move to v7 in early 2023.

For all who can't upgrade their projects to v7 we will maintain v6.1.x for some time, primarily by merging your bug fixes and backports.

## Future Lookout

We do our best to review and merge your bug fix PRs. Please don't expect 
the team to fix bugs for you, everyone participating in this project is doing it in their own precious free time and it is simply 
impossible for us to provide free support for everyone. That being said, we feel responsible for MudBlazor and will keep it going 
for a long time to come at a sustainable cost of free time by merging important bug fixes and the one or other new feature if 
significant.
