# MudBlazor Roadmap

MudBlazor is growing, with a significant reduction in the number of bugs.
We remain committed to maintaining and improving the project, but as a non-commercial project we rely heavily on community contributions.
We try to review and merge important bug fixes as soon as possible, so if your bug-fix pull request (PR) is overlooked, please tag a team member.

## .NET Versions

We fully support both .NET 7 and .NET 8, and our top priority is to continue supporting upcoming .NET versions.

## Breaking Changes

We avoided breaking changes for a very long time and have now finally merged several of them and removed all obsolete APIs from v6 in the move to v7.
Please view the [v7.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/8447) to get an idea of what changes you will have to make in your projects.

We may make further breaking changes in the future, but we will try to keep them to a minimum and provide a migration guide for each major release.

For those unable to immediately upgrade their projects to v7:
We will maintain v6.x for some time, largely relying on community contributions for bug fixes and backports.

## Looking Ahead

Right now we are focused on getting v7 stable and bug-free.
After v7 has settled we will start proper work on v8.
You can find our current plans on the [v8 project board](https://github.com/orgs/MudBlazor/projects/3).
There is no ETA currently, but we aim to have more regular major releases with less breaking changes in the future.

Understand that our team members contribute to this project during their personal free time, so please don't expect the team to fix bugs for you.
It's not feasible for us to offer free support to everyone, but we do our best to review and merge your PRs.
That being said, we feel responsible for MudBlazor and intend to keep it going for the foreseeable future at a sustainable cost of free time by merging important bug fixes and new features if they enhance the project.

Please keep giving us your ideas so we can consider them for upcoming versions!
