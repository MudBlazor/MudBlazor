# MudBlazor Roadmap

MudBlazor is stable, with a significant reduction in the number of bugs. We remain committed to maintaining and improving the project, but as a non-commercial prokect we rely heavily on our users for bug fixes. We try to review and merge important bug fixes as soon as possible, so if your bug-fix pull request (PR) is overlooked, please tag a team member.

## Future .NET Versions

We fully support both .NET 7 and .NET 8, and our top priority is to continue supporting upcoming .NET versions.

## Upcoming Breaking Changes

We have put off breaking changes for a very long time and are now in the process of merging breaking changes and removing all obsolete parameters as we move to v7. Don't panic, we'll announce a release date for when we feel confident that we can hold it. 

For those unable to upgrade their projects to v7, we will maintain v6.x for some time, largely relying on community contributions for bug fixes and backports.

## Looking Ahed

We do our best to review and merge your bug fix PRs. Please don't expect the team to fix bugs for you. Everyone participating in this project is doing it on their own precious free time and it is simply impossible for us to provide free support for everyone. That being said, we feel responsible for MudBlazor and will keep it going for a long time to come at a sustainable cost of free time by merging important bug fixes and the one or other new feature if  significant. 

## Get Involved!

Contributions from the community are what makes MudBlazor successful. If you are an experienced developer proficient in technologies such as C#, Blazor, JavaScript, or CSS, and you wish to give something back, please contact the team on Discord. You can join our Contribution Team channel and discuss with other team members what you want to do to help and start making a difference on this very roadmap.
